It's time to learn some web development fundamentals.

Go through each of these:

* [Learn Enough Text Editor to Be Dangerous](http://www.learnenough.com/text-editor-tutorial)
* [Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous](http://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial)
* [Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous](http://www.learnenough.com/html-tutorial)
