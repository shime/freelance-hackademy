## Step 3 - Installing Ruby locally

In this step we're going to set up the latest stable version of Ruby on your machine.

We're going to assume you're using Linux or MacOS. If you're using Windows, I would suggest using [Ruby Installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/) since it looks like the most normal option out there. If you're using you can skip this step.

We're going to use [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) with [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install).

### Installing chruby

These commands will install chruby on your machine

```
wget -O chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/archive/v0.3.9.tar.gz
tar -xzvf chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz
cd chruby-0.3.9/
sudo make install
```

Then add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zhsrc`

```
source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh
source /usr/local/share/chruby/auto.sh
```

### Installing ruby-install

These commands will install ruby-install

```
wget -O ruby-install-0.6.1.tar.gz https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install/archive/v0.6.1.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ruby-install-0.6.1.tar.gz
cd ruby-install-0.6.1/
sudo make install
```

### Installing Ruby

When you're done installing **chruby** and **ruby-install** you're ready to install latest stable version of Ruby. 

That version is currently **2.5.0**.

Install Ruby with these commands

```
ruby-install ruby 2.5.0
```

Make version **2.5.0** the default Ruby version on your machine, add this to the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`

```
chruby 2.5.0
```

Make sure you're using the correct Ruby version

```
ruby -v
```

The output should say that you're using Ruby 2.5.0.
