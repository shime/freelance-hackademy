## Step 5 - Finish Rails tutorial

### Install Bundler and Rails

In order to install gems from Gemfile, a file used to specify dependencies for your Ruby projects you have to have Bundler installed. 

This command will install Bundler

```
gem install bundler
```

This command will install Rails

```
gem install rails -v 5.1.4
```

And you're ready to start with your first Rails project!

### Finish the tutorial

Follow instructions on [Rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/) and complete the entire tutorial, but be careful:

* Feel free to skip chapter **1.2**, since we've already set up the environment. We're going to develop code locally instead of using Cloud9.
* Use Github instead of Bitbucket, you will not enter any sensitive data in your application.
* Skip writing all the tests, since the author is getting too advanced with writing tests before the implementation (TDD). Skip any code examples or commands mentioning tests.
